        <h2>FAQ</h2>
        <h3>Why PHP?</h3>
        <p>Started with that, it's pretty easy.</p>
        <p>Plus I built a lot of my infrastructure using PHP,</p>
        <p>migrating to something other would just be a pain in the dick.</p>
        <h3>What's up with the indents?</h3>
        <p>I use a bunch of PHP includes.</p>
        <p>Indents for those get messed up in the final page.</p>
        <h3>Why not release your site as a .zip file or a git repository?</h3>
        <p>That'd need cleaning up, which I can't bother to do.</p>
        <p>Also we already use git internally.</p>
        <h3>Why X license and not Y?</h3>
        <p>Because I like these licenses.</p>
        <h3>You're gay</h3>
        <p>no u</p>
