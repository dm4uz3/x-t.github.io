<p>Just because it was now convenient to do so, and my source code got a lot cleaner, I made my site's source code public.</p>
<p>It's hosted on GitHub, check it out <a href="https://github.com/x-t/x-t.github.io">here</a>.</p>
<p>I also switched to the GPLv3, replacing the previous BSD-2-Clause license.</p>
<p>Although you probably shouldn't contribute, you can look at the source code.</p>
<p>And maybe repurpose the build system if you want, I don't know. It's just open, that's all.</p>
